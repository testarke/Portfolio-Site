             <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/trent-starkey-39434915a/" target = "_blank"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGFNx1O0w-XKQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1652182679833?e=1689206400&v=beta&t=2HGZ2_hfuVXgk3aISZQmI1S74NX7EHsixTTKKZkyqr4" alt= "My LinkedIn"></a>
            <p>I am a fully self taught, hopeful and prospective engineer and member of <a href= "https://www.techlahoma.org" target = "_blank" alt= "Techlahoma">Techlahoma</a> living in Oklahoma City. Hailing from The University of Central Oklahoma's class of 2021, my introduction to the workforce came from biopharmaceutical manufacturing here in OKC. I consider myself a creative, often following that string as it takes me to multiple different mediums and hobbies.</p>
                <p> Although I'm in the infancy of my programming journey, I am dedicated to learning the skills, underlying knowledge, and mindset that a great engineer must possess. Front end may be my springboard, but I'm coming for the full stack! Come along with me on this journey!</p>

            <h4> My Learning Journey </h4>
            <p> Okay... maybe self taught is a stretch...</p>
                <p> As we all know, a plethora of resources exist to learn programming languages. Such resources include...</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Bootcamps </li>
                        <p>Bootcamps provide a level of accountability that could be benefit me and even employ me faster. Howevever, my research has found widespread complaints towards boot camp grads who struggle to have the basic knowhow for the role at hand.  I'm dedicated to a slower, more encompassing approach- going out of my way to focus on computer architecture, file hieracrchies, mathmatical concepts such as linear algebra and calculus, and much more. </p>
                    <li> B.S. Computer Science </li>
                        <p> What's better than one degree? Two! (...maybe?)</p>
                        <p> While a shiny computer science degree may just help me land an engineer role and teach me all the extra I need to do so well, I see it as a bit redundant. As a STEM major with experience in R and NCBI Galaxy and a high GPA, I believe the proof is in the pudding. That is, if you'll accept pudding as a slang word for college transcript.</p>
